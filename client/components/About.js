        Birchwood West founder Alex Sobiloff is a software engineer, writer,
        and photographer. He started Birchwood West to solve two problems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The first was the tech industy's exclusive attitude toward new
        engineers. Often times, lesser experienced developers cannot get the
        attention they deserve regardless of their abilities. The industry's
        benchmarks for measuring candidate potential is often outdated,
        inaccurate, and unnecessarily stressful for the candidate. Birchwood
        West has a different process for discovering talented individuals. We
        call it "conversation". Birchwood West prioritizes passion,
        dedication, eagerness to learn, and communication above specific
        knowledge or skill set.

        The second problem was the lack of attention toward small businesses.
        As the son of a single mother and long time small business owner, Alex
        started learning from a young age about the fundamental gap that existed 
        between large and small businesses, as well as the plight that so many 
        small businesses deal with. The constant juggle between company time 
        and budget can be an exhausting dance. The fact is, building a web 
        presence yourself with one of the many online platforms can seem like 
        a good idea to save money. But inevitably, as time gets tight, the 
        website is the first sacrifice to be made. The result ends up being a 
        half finished and never updated site that leaves a small business 
        looking...well, small. The answer? Deliver a great product at an 
        affordable price and give small business owners their valuable time 
        back.
